# Image Track Slider

![Demo](readme-gif/ezgif-60fd2fb77216fcd1.gif)

Just a fun little image slider I built after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkADl0HubMY). Drag the images left or right to slide through them—super smooth, no libraries, just vanilla JS and CSS.

**Try it:**
- Clone this repo
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Drag away!
